## Open implementation of the Quansheng UV-K5/K6/5R firmware

Based on *egzumer* repository and the work of DualTachyon's open firmware found [here](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) ... a cool achievement !

> [!WARNING]  
> *Use this firmware at your own risk (entirely). There is absolutely no guarantee that it will work in any way shape or form on your radio(s), it may even brick your radio(s), in which case, you'd need to buy another radio.*

> [!WARNING]
> *After some unfortunate incidents by users I'm going to put this warning and disclaimer up. DO NOT attempt to transmit without the proper precautions in place. Transmitting 5W of RF energy centimetres away from a PC can LITERALLY destroy it, it's almost like an EMP at that distance. Get your antenna away from the PC.*

Anyway, have fun.
